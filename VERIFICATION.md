# Assembly Scanner 0.1.1 verification

## Windows build and upstream review

The package was built and run on Windows 11 Pro x64 build 26200 with an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, using Rust 1.99.1 and the x64 MSVC toolchain. The PE header identifies a Windows GUI x64 executable. The import table uses Windows system DLLs and OpenGL. The application test suite passed five tests. The published ethernetip-connections 0.1.1 crate passed its 27 unit tests on the same Windows host.

- The published scanner uses Tokio TCP and UDP. It registers a session, opens a cyclic Class 1 point-to-point connection, uses the returned O→T actual interval for production, and exchanges CPF sequenced address and connected data items. Its producer uses a Tokio interval with missed ticks set to Skip. Its receiver updates a shared assembly snapshot and has no public per-packet timestamp/sequence callback. The scanner source also uses one Run/Idle flag in setup and decodes incoming data without an input Run/Idle header. [Published scanner source](https://docs.rs/crate/ethernetip-connections/0.1.1/source/src/scanner.rs)
- The application uses the published Forward_Open and Forward_Close codecs and the core TCP encapsulation and CPF codecs. Its connection worker binds both transports to the selected local IPv4 address. The independent OpENer source identifies 0x8000 as O→T Sockaddr Info and 0x8001 as T→O. Its fixed Class 1 connection size includes the two-byte sequence count. These wire details differ from the crate's stock scanner. [OpENer CPF constants](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer/blob/0e1ab7ee5c272950c0dc8daf7793008d7a518912/source/src/enet_encap/cpf.h), [OpENer I/O connection source](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer/blob/0e1ab7ee5c272950c0dc8daf7793008d7a518912/source/src/cip/cipioconnection.c), [ODVA CPF wire overview](https://www.odva.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PUB00123R1_Common-Industrial_Protocol_and_Family_of_CIP_Networks.pdf)
- The prototype has separate producer, receive and CSV writer threads. The deadline producer uses absolute monotonic deadlines, a sleep with a short spin guard, and skips missed slots. The Tokio baseline uses the stock interval policy on the same application packet path and socket. This comparison isolates the scheduler policy. The stock scanner's full stack was evaluated from source and unit tests.

## Simulator timing

The independent Python adapter and the real Windows GUI ran on the same host over localhost, with CSV capture and three-second rotation active. Each run was about 12 seconds. Both directions requested 1,000 µs in both runs and Forward_Open returned 1,000 µs for each direction. All spacing below is in microseconds.

| Scheduler | Measurement point | p50 | p95 | p99 | Longest |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Deadline | Scanner O→T send | 1,022 | 1,153 | 1,424 | 2,547 |
| Deadline | Fixture O→T receive | 1,019 | 2,020 | 2,170 | 3,498 |
| Deadline | Scanner T→O receive | 1,006 | 1,176 | 1,372 | 2,473 |
| Tokio Skip | Scanner O→T send | 1,029 | 1,639 | 2,123 | 3,142 |
| Tokio Skip | Fixture O→T receive | 1,023 | 2,115 | 2,544 | 3,434 |
| Tokio Skip | Scanner T→O receive | 1,004 | 1,225 | 1,466 | 2,786 |

| Scheduler | Scanner O→T sent / fixture received | Fixture T→O sent / scanner accepted / CSV written | Sequence gaps O→T / T→O | CSV overruns |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Deadline | 11,893 / 11,893 | 11,897 / 11,897 / 11,897 | 0 / 0 | 0 |
| Tokio Skip | 11,889 / 11,889 | 11,880 / 11,880 / 11,880 | 0 / 0 | 0 |

Both runs had zero duplicates, late packets, invalid frames, timeouts and disk errors. The scanner deadline loop skipped 5 scheduled send slots. The Tokio baseline reports no missed-slot count. The fixture producer skipped 2 slots during the deadline run and 9 during the Tokio run. Skipped scheduler slots occur before a packet sequence is assigned and are reported independently from sequence gaps. Timing varied across runs and process load. In these runs, the deadline policy lowered scanner send p99 by approximately 33%.

## Windows wait-handle reuse

The deadline producer on Windows now reuses one high-resolution waitable timer per producer. It keeps the same monotonic deadline, final spin guard, and missed-slot policy. If the dedicated timer is unavailable, the producer uses the standard sleep path. The Tokio baseline is unchanged. Rust's Windows sleep already attempts a high-resolution timer and creates one per call. [Rust Windows sleep source](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/sys/thread/windows.rs), [Windows high-resolution timer API](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-createwaitabletimerexw)

The previous build (`55fa1c0`) and reused-handle build ran three trials each, in alternating pair order, on the same Windows host. The independent localhost fixture, GUI, and rotating CSV writer were active for about 12 seconds per trial. Both directions requested and negotiated 1,000 µs in all six trials. Each cell shows the range of the three per-run measurements in microseconds.

| Build | Measurement point | p50 | p95 | p99 | Longest |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Previous | Scanner O→T send | 1,025–1,029 | 1,191–1,231 | 1,481–1,538 | 2,548–7,528 |
| Reused handle | Scanner O→T send | 1,021–1,039 | 1,168–1,234 | 1,458–1,473 | 2,573–14,472 |
| Previous | Fixture O→T receive | 1,023–1,028 | 2,037–2,084 | 2,220–2,312 | 3,164–7,627 |
| Reused handle | Fixture O→T receive | 1,020–1,034 | 2,037–2,088 | 2,236–2,293 | 3,544–15,126 |
| Previous | Fixture T→O send | 1,008–1,014 | 1,202–1,231 | 1,418–1,515 | 2,475–6,933 |
| Reused handle | Fixture T→O send | 1,008–1,017 | 1,174–1,217 | 1,418–1,452 | 2,535–15,281 |
| Previous | Scanner T→O receive | 1,008–1,014 | 1,202–1,240 | 1,419–1,520 | 2,481–6,900 |
| Reused handle | Scanner T→O receive | 1,008–1,016 | 1,181–1,217 | 1,422–1,451 | 2,538–15,194 |

| Build | Scanner skipped send slots | Fixture skipped send slots | Sequence gaps O→T / T→O | CSV rows | CSV overruns | Timeouts |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Previous | 86 | 123 | 0 / 2 | 35,532 | 0 | 0 |
| Reused handle | 46 | 36 | 0 / 0 | 35,538 | 0 | 0 |

All runs closed cleanly. The median per-run scanner send p99 changed from 1,535 to 1,464 µs. The candidate's longest send gap was worse in one trial, when the fixture also recorded a long send gap. This comparison qualifies the offline implementation only. [Physical bench acceptance](https://github.com/votecoffee/EthernetIPWorkbench/issues/2) remains open.

## Offline functional checks

- The Rust tests exercised signed, floating-point and bit decoding, endian order and out-of-range selection, plus EDS profile parsing, unresolved paths, and safe single-byte ParamN path resolution.
- An eight-sample ring and an intentionally delayed writer accepted eight of 100 offered samples, counted 92 overruns and flushed the eight accepted rows across size-rotated parts on stop. A forced collision at the second time-rotated part left the original file intact, raised a disk error and reported one flushed row out of two seen.
- The GUI fixture checked rotation, strict CSV parsing, repeated values and sample-index continuity. Packet fault injection exercised a skipped sequence, duplicate, delayed sequence and invalid payload. The stall case counted a receive timeout and performed Forward_Close. Forward_Open rejection preserved CIP general status 0x01 and extended status 0x0109 in the connection error field.
- With requests of 1,000 / 1,000 µs, the fixture also returned different intervals of 1,250 / 1,500 µs for O→T / T→O. The app reported the returned values separately and used them for its cyclic timing.
- A loopback-only exclusive-owner test checked the padded configuration segment, Run/Idle framing in each direction, and the transition between two staged output buffers. The reconnect test kept one CSV capture across two connections and verified the generation change with contiguous sample indexes.

Historical simulator reports were bundled with the original development packages. The portable preview includes this summary and its build manifest. Device-specific captures stay outside the package.

## Concurrent adapter sessions

The Windows GUI ran two independent localhost fixtures in a single process. The adapters used distinct serial numbers, UDP endpoints, and input values. The healthy adapter requested 8,000 µs in both directions and the stalled adapter requested 16,000 µs. Each fixture returned the same intervals in Forward_Open.

| Stream | End state | CSV rows / parts | T→O sequence gaps | CSV overruns |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Healthy | Closed | 1,476 / 4 | 1 | 0 |
| Stalled | Timed out | 75 / 1 | 0 | 0 |

A repeat wrote 1,483 healthy and 75 stalled rows with zero sequence gaps or overruns on either stream.

Both fixtures received Forward_Close. Each stream had contiguous CSV sample indexes and every accepted sample was written to the correct stream. The captures overlapped and the healthy stream recorded for more than five seconds after the stalled stream's last sample. The receive timeout was counted only on the stalled adapter. These results cover simulated input-only sessions.

```powershell
python tools/benchmark.py .\target\release\assembly-scanner.exe .\.local\dual-adapter-check --dual-only
```

## Headless recovery

Three concurrent Windows CLI captures used separate localhost fixtures at an 8 ms RPI in both directions. Forward_Open returned 8 ms for both directions. One fixture stalled and resumed after its first reconnect delay. A second fault was injected by placing an existing file at the disk stream's next CSV part.

| Stream | Result | CSV rows | Timeouts | T→O sequence gaps | CSV overruns |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Healthy | Completed throughout both faults | 752 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Recovered | Completed across generations 1 and 2 | 468 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Disk fault | Reported the collision and exited incomplete | 250 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

A repeat recorded one sequence gap on the healthy stream and zero on the recovered stream. Both completed with zero overruns.

The recovered stream retained its UTC start and contiguous sample indexes. The disk stream saw 252 rows and confirmed 250 written. The existing file was preserved. A separate fixture changed its serial number after a timeout. The scanner preserved the 75 previously captured rows and rejected the new identity before Forward_Open. Rust tests cover the bounded retry delays, GUI retry cancellation, and releasing a failed GUI capture slot while another writer continues.

```powershell
python tools/test_recovery.py .\target\release\eipmaster-cli.exe .\.local\recovery-check
```

## OpENer compatibility

The Windows CLI captured from the upstream OpENer sample adapter, built with MSVC from revision `0e1ab7ee`. The test launcher binds all adapter sockets to 127.0.0.2, supplies a synthetic MAC address, and fills the 32-byte input assembly with values 0 through 31. The adapter uses the upstream Class 1 stack and sample connection points. [Upstream sample EDS](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer/blob/0e1ab7ee5c272950c0dc8daf7793008d7a518912/data/opener_sample_app.eds) · [Upstream sample application](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer/blob/0e1ab7ee5c272950c0dc8daf7793008d7a518912/source/src/ports/WIN32/sample_application/sampleapplication.c)

EDS Connection2 resolves to input assembly 100, heartbeat point 152, and configuration instance 151 with zero configuration bytes. Both directions requested 30,000 µs and Forward_Open returned 30,000 µs in both directions. The Identity Object reported vendor 1, type 12, product 65001, revision 2.3, and serial 123456789. The target trace recorded Forward_Close.

The first 60-second run wrote all 2,000 accepted samples with one receive sequence gap, zero duplicates, zero invalid packets, zero timeouts, and zero CSV overruns. Socket spacing was measured separately.

| Direction | p50 µs | p95 µs | p99 µs | Longest µs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Scanner O→T send | 29,988 | 30,486 | 35,967 | 46,692 |
| Scanner T→O receive | 30,412 | 31,886 | 32,435 | 60,705 |

The reproducible run with rotation wrote all 1,989 accepted samples across six CSV parts. It reported 12 receive sequence gaps and zero CSV overruns, duplicates, invalid packets or timeouts. OpENer logged 2,001 sends with no socket send error. This comparison does not identify where the missing datagrams were dropped. The receive p50, p95, p99 and longest gap were 30,726, 31,980, 32,895 and 62,853 µs, respectively.

This check exposed the previous 20,000 µs percentile ceiling. The fixed histogram retains exact microsecond buckets through 32,767 µs and reports a bounded upper estimate for longer intervals. CSV elapsed times independently reproduced the receive percentiles within that resolution.

To repeat the headless test, install CMake and the Visual Studio 2022 C++ toolchain. Use a fresh output directory and a full upstream Git checkout. The tool builds a local copy of the pinned revision and keeps the upstream EDS, logs and CSV parts in the test directory.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer.git .local/opener-upstream
python tools/test_opener.py .\target\release\eipmaster-cli.exe .\.local\opener-upstream .\.local\opener-check
```

## Headless bench sequence

The CLI `qualify` command preserves each trial's capture report and CSV alongside the effective profiles and a cumulative receipt. The short loopback check exercised the 8 ms baseline and all three 1 ms trials. A fixture that returned 1,250 and 1,500 µs on one target trial produced a failed qualification receipt and still ran the remaining trials. An interval mismatch on the baseline stopped before the target trials. A same-model serial mismatch stopped before Forward_Open, including when the serial changed after the baseline. A profile with configuration bytes was rejected before any connection attempt.

```powershell
python tools/test_cli.py .\target\release\eipmaster-cli.exe .\.local\qualification-check --qualification
```

A full headless loopback sequence requested 8,000 µs in both directions for the 15-second baseline and 1,000 µs for three 60-second trials. Forward_Open returned the corresponding requested intervals on all four runs. The receipt correctly reported a failed qualification.

| Run | Sample span | End state | CSV rows | Receive sequence gaps | Scanner missed send slots | Fixture missed send slots |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 ms baseline | 15.008 s | Closed | 1,849 | 28 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 ms trial 1 | 60.012 s | Closed | 50,758 | 93 | 5,178 | 9,162 |
| 1 ms trial 2 | 38.554 s | Timed out | 36,821 | 18 | 1,000 | 1,748 |
| 1 ms trial 3 | 16.599 s | Timed out | 15,144 | 24 | 849 | 1,470 |

| Run | Receive p50 / p95 / p99 / longest (µs) | Send p50 / p95 / p99 / longest (µs) |
|---|---:|---:|
| 8 ms baseline | 8,010 / 9,410 / 16,069 / 19,979 | 8,010 / 9,187 / 10,098 / 16,670 |
| 1 ms trial 1 | 1,044 / 2,485 / 4,698 / 26,259 | 1,054 / 2,001 / 2,764 / 7,728 |
| 1 ms trial 2 | 1,022 / 1,411 / 2,600 / 21,042 | 1,030 / 1,457 / 2,123 / 7,658 |
| 1 ms trial 3 | 1,031 / 1,768 / 3,372 / 22,904 | 1,034 / 1,755 / 2,473 / 6,515 |

The fixture received Forward_Close on all four runs. All accepted packets were present in the rotated CSV parts with contiguous sample indexes. There were zero buffer overruns and disk errors. Spacing describes intervals between received packets. The terminal watchdog silence has no later packet to measure as an interval. These results are from localhost with the GUI closed.

## Windows receive readiness and watchdog evidence

The previous full headless sequence ended twice at a 32 ms receive watchdog limit. In one run the fixture recorded a 39.777 ms send gap. In the other its longest measured send gap was 27.872 ms. The earlier reports did not correlate the exact watchdog event with a fixture send timestamp, so the immediate causes remain unconfirmed.

On Windows the receiver now uses Winsock `select` to wait for readable UDP data before calling `recvfrom`. The receiver requests a 2 ms idle wait and keeps the same watchdog limits. [Winsock readiness semantics](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-select)

Three alternating 10-second pairs per RPI compared the timed receive build (`83f19bf`) with the readiness build on the same localhost fixture. The requested intervals and Forward_Open intervals matched the listed RPI in both directions.

| RPI | Receive path | Accepted and written | Sequence gaps | Per-run receive p99 range (µs) | Longest receive gap (µs) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 ms | Timed receive | 3,750 | 4 | 8,402–8,620 | 18,507 |
| 8 ms | Readiness | 3,753 | 0 | 8,494–8,623 | 9,834 |
| 1 ms | Timed receive | 29,894 | 6 | 1,492–1,622 | 11,812 |
| 1 ms | Readiness | 29,815 | 0 | 1,495–1,803 | 4,409 |

All runs closed cleanly with zero receive watchdog timeouts and zero CSV overruns. The fixture skipped 132 send slots in the timed 1 ms trials and 227 in the readiness trials. Skipped fixture slots occur before sequence assignment. The trials show fewer received sequence gaps with readiness on this host. They did not reproduce the earlier watchdog failures.

A separate 60-second readiness run requested 1,000 µs in both directions and received 1,000 µs in both directions from Forward_Open. It closed cleanly with 58,772 accepted and written rows, zero receive sequence gaps, zero watchdog timeouts, and zero CSV overruns.

| Measurement point | p50 µs | p95 µs | p99 µs | Longest µs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Scanner T→O receive | 1,047 | 1,365 | 1,818 | 4,923 |
| Scanner O→T send | 1,043 | 1,280 | 1,708 | 4,785 |
| Fixture T→O send | 1,046 | 1,369 | 1,805 | 5,573 |

The scanner skipped 524 send slots and the fixture skipped 1,243. The scan and CSV capture ran headlessly over localhost.

Timeout reports now include the threshold, terminal silence, time since any received UDP datagram, and the last valid sequence when available. The headless CLI tests distinguish a quiet first-input wait from a first-input wait with malformed traffic. The recovery test checks a cyclic watchdog's terminal sequence against its last CSV sample.

## Producer timing and thread priority

The sender records lateness when it reaches a deadline and wall time around the UDP send call. A long call can include time when Windows descheduled the thread. These measurements describe separate points and can come from different packets.

The opt-in deadline mode requests `THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL` only for the cyclic producer thread. The sender reports whether Windows accepted the request. [Windows thread scheduling priorities](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/procthread/scheduling-priorities)

Three alternating pairs ran two concurrent 12-second CLI captures with three-second CSV rotation. Both streams requested and negotiated 1,000 µs in both directions. The primary stream alternated between normal and above-normal deadline scheduling. The peer always used the normal deadline schedule. All twelve captures closed cleanly with zero sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, or CSV overruns.

| Primary producer priority | Primary missed slots per run | Peer missed slots per run | Primary send p99 range (µs) | Primary maximum send gap (µs) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Normal | 5 / 77 / 27 | 7 / 60 / 18 | 1,230–1,412 | 4,325 |
| Above normal | 2 / 2 / 4 | 61 / 6 / 8 | 1,204–1,335 | 2,859 |

The primary's maximum dispatch lateness was 3,487 µs at normal priority and 1,736 µs at above-normal priority. Its longest UDP call measured 2,695 µs and 1,761 µs, respectively. Peer performance varied between pairs, and the first above-normal trial had 61 peer misses versus seven in its normal-priority pair. Normal priority remains the default.

A separate 60-second run used above-normal priority on the primary and normal priority on the peer. Both requested 1,000 µs and both negotiated 1,000 µs in each direction. Each wrote 59,627 accepted packets to seven CSV parts with zero sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, or CSV overruns.

| Stream | Missed producer slots | O→T send p50 / p95 / p99 / longest (µs) | T→O receive p50 / p95 / p99 / longest (µs) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Above-normal primary | 40 | 1,075 / 1,151 / 1,221 / 3,963 | 1,065 / 1,197 / 1,466 / 4,986 |
| Normal peer | 320 | 1,073 / 1,186 / 1,479 / 5,174 | 1,063 / 1,217 / 1,638 / 4,710 |

The fixture producers missed 384 and 383 slots, respectively. The primary's worst dispatch lateness was 2,817 µs and its longest UDP send call was 579 µs. The peer recorded 4,612 µs and 2,712 µs, with six send calls lasting at least one RPI. These are headless localhost measurements.

## Graceful console stops

The CLI integration test sent real Windows console events inside an isolated windowless console. The adapter fixture confirmed Forward_Close in every case.

| Event and state | Preserved CSV rows | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| Ctrl+Break after capture rotated | 131 across two parts | Exit 130 and interrupted capture report |
| Ctrl+C during the qualification baseline | 5 | Exit 130 and interrupted qualification receipt with no later trials |
| Ctrl+C during the automatic reconnect delay | 75 | Exit 130 and no new connection attempt |

All accepted rows reached disk with contiguous sample indexes and zero buffer overruns. The windowless test harness requires Windows 11 build 26100 or later. It verifies the process list before sending either event. [Windows console control events](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/console/ctrl-c-and-ctrl-break-signals)

```powershell
python tools/test_interrupt.py .\target\release\eipmaster-cli.exe .\.local\interrupt-check
```

## Packet span and long intervals

A headless 60-second Windows loopback capture requested 1,000 microseconds in both directions. Forward_Open returned 1,000 microseconds in both directions. The capture closed cleanly and wrote all 58,770 accepted rows across seven CSV parts with contiguous sample indexes, zero receive sequence gaps, zero watchdog timeouts, and zero CSV overruns.

| Socket measurement | Observed span (s) | p50 / p95 / p99 / longest (microseconds) | Intervals at or above 2x / 4x actual RPI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| O-to-T send | 60.013080 | 1,022 / 1,326 / 1,825 / 15,697 | 492 / 86 |
| T-to-O receive | 60.013486 | 1,007 / 1,288 / 1,810 / 20,479 | 481 / 92 |

The scanner skipped 1,128 scheduled sends and the fixture skipped 1,244. Both skip slots before assigning a sequence. The long-interval counts describe socket timing even when the sequence is contiguous. The 4x counts are included in the 2x counts.

The 8 ms and 1 ms CLI checks cross-checked the receive span and long-interval counts against CSV timestamps. The qualification regression also checked a fixture returning 1,250 microseconds O-to-T and 1,500 microseconds T-to-O for a 1,000-microsecond request. The thresholds follow the actual interval for each direction. The CSV comparison allows for sub-microsecond truncation at the interval boundaries.

## GUI run report

A headless test exercised the GUI device model with the independent localhost adapter. It armed CSV, connected at a requested 1,000 microseconds in both directions, received 1,250 and 1,500 microseconds from Forward_Open, disconnected, flushed, and saved the report. The report kept the requested and actual intervals separate, matched accepted packets to written rows, and recorded the final connection state. The adapter confirmed Forward_Close.

Additional tests verified that a later connection cannot change the saved capture's connection context, that timeout details survive subsequent draft changes, and that an existing report is preserved. A rotation failure reported the disk error and one unconfirmed row separately from buffer overruns.

To repeat the loopback check, run the fixture in one terminal and the GUI backend test in another. The test opens no window.

```powershell
python tools/loopback_adapter.py .local/report-adapter.json --mode different-api
```

```powershell
cargo test --locked --release --bin assembly-scanner run_report_uses_the_final_loopback_connection -- --ignored
```

## Forward_Close confirmation

The scanner checks the connection serial number, originator vendor ID, and originator serial number in a successful Forward_Close reply. The run reports distinguish confirmation, a CIP rejection, and an unconfirmed close. These fields are independent of any earlier receive timeout or I/O error. [OpENer response implementation](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer/blob/0e1ab7ee5c272950c0dc8daf7793008d7a518912/source/src/cip/cipconnectionmanager.c#L1087)

| Headless 8 ms loopback case | End state | Close outcome | CSV rows |
|---|---|---|---:|
| CIP rejection | Close unconfirmed | Rejected (0x01, extended 0x0107) | 251 |
| Mismatched connection identifiers | Close unconfirmed | Unconfirmed | 251 |
| Truncated success reply | Close unconfirmed | Unconfirmed | 251 |
| TCP closed before reply | Close unconfirmed | Unconfirmed | 251 |
| Receive watchdog, then CIP rejection | Timed out | Rejected (0x01, extended 0x0107) | 75 |

All five captures reported failure and saved all accepted rows. Qualification saved the first 1 ms trial after a close rejection and stopped before opening another connection. The headless GUI backend, reconnect, and Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break tests also verified confirmed closes in their receipts.

An independent three-second OpENer run requested and negotiated 30 ms in each direction. The scanner confirmed Forward_Close and wrote 101 accepted rows with zero sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, or CSV overruns. These checks used localhost software adapters.

## Observed packet rates

The CLI uses the first accepted packet to anchor the capture deadline. A clock test verified that later packets update the live age without moving that anchor. The GUI and run reports compute the observed rate from interval count divided by the first-to-last packet span. They compare each direction against its Forward_Open interval.

An 8 ms loopback fixture produced input every 16 ms while advancing the sequence on each send. The scanner measured 50.0% of the negotiated input rate. The capture reported zero sequence gaps and zero CSV overruns. The CLI tests cross-checked the receive span against CSV timestamps and both rates against their spans and negotiated intervals.

A separate 60-second headless loopback run requested 1,000 microseconds in both directions and Forward_Open returned 1,000 microseconds in both directions. It closed cleanly and wrote all 59,950 accepted input rows across seven CSV parts with contiguous indexes, zero receive sequence gaps, zero watchdog timeouts, and zero CSV overruns.

| Socket measurement | Observed span (s) | Packets per second | Percent of negotiated rate | p99 / longest (microseconds) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| O-to-T send | 60.009960 | 998.8 | 99.88 | 1,463 / 15,161 |
| T-to-O receive | 60.010275 | 999.0 | 99.90 | 1,482 / 3,624 |

The scanner skipped 72 scheduled sends and the fixture skipped 61. These were loopback socket measurements.

## Logged field summaries

The CSV writer summarizes each selected column across rotated parts. The reports include the mapping, first and last saved values, finite numeric bounds, and changes between adjacent saved rows in the same connection generation. Unit tests cover exact 64-bit integer bounds, nonfinite floats, quoted text, on-change logging, rotation, and disk failure.

A 60-second localhost run used a synthetic 32-byte input assembly with three signed 32-bit fields. Two fields varied and each reported 3,675 changes. The third field was constant and reported zero changes. All three summaries matched the independently parsed CSV values, and all 58,808 accepted rows were saved across six parts with contiguous sample indexes.

Both directions requested 1,000 microseconds and Forward_Open returned 1,000 microseconds. The input rate was 980.1 packets per second with a receive p99 of 1,688 microseconds and a longest interval of 29,883 microseconds. There were zero sequence gaps, receive timeouts, or CSV overruns. The scanner skipped 905 scheduled sends and the fixture skipped 1,196. The run confirmed Forward_Close.

## Report-checked CSV joins

The headless recovery check joined a finalized capture across two connection generations and verified the saved rows against the capture report. Relocating the CSV parts preserved verification. Copies with a missing final part, missing rows in the final part, or an altered last value were rejected. An attempted join with missing rows left no partial output.

A synthetic GUI report accounted for one visible sample-index gap and one overrun after the last saved row. The joined CSV preserved multiline text, empty cells, leading zeros, and the exact decimal text of a full-width unsigned value. A report with no recorded overrun rejected the same index gap. A run report containing a CSV writer error was rejected.

The check also verified all 58,808 rows of an earlier six-part loopback capture using its original report. That report predated the part-count field and supplied the written row count and field summaries.

## GUI reconnect history

The headless GUI backend test ran an 8 ms input-only capture against the loopback adapter and kept CSV armed through a receive stall and automatic reconnect. The report preserved generation 1 as timed out with a 256 ms watchdog threshold and generation 2 as closed. Both entries retained the matching identity, negotiated intervals, and a confirmed Forward_Close. The adapter observed both close requests.

All 127 accepted rows reached the rotated CSV parts. The compatibility `[connection]` section matched the final attempt, and the capture totals covered both generations. A unit test also verified that a later connection outside the capture leaves its report history intact.

The 8 ms CLI regression and recovery tests passed. Two separate 1 ms CLI regressions hit the receive watchdog. The first fixture reached a 32.262 ms send interval in the mismatched-close case. The report preserved the timeout and mismatched close reply and saved all 668 accepted rows. The retry reached 32.339 ms of terminal input silence in the on-change capture. Its report accounted for 2,337 accepted packets as 147 saved rows and 2,190 packets filtered as unchanged, with a confirmed Forward_Close. These were localhost checks.

Start the fixture in one terminal and run the GUI backend test in another. The test opens no window.

```powershell
python tools/loopback_adapter.py .local/report-recovery-adapter.json --mode recover
```

```powershell
cargo test --locked --release --bin assembly-scanner run_report_keeps_loopback_reconnect_attempts -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## Configurable CIP watchdog

An independent loopback fixture read the timeout code from the Forward_Open request. It returned 1,250 microseconds O-to-T and 1,500 microseconds T-to-O for an 8 ms request in both directions, then paused input after sequence 75. Code 3 (32 times the interval) timed out after 48.824 ms of silence with a 48 ms limit and saved 75 rows. Code 4 (64 times the interval) completed with a 96 ms limit, observed a 61.478 ms input gap, and saved 632 rows. Both captures accounted for all accepted packets and confirmed Forward_Close. [Timeout code encoding](https://www.hilscher.com/fileadmin/cms_upload/de/Resources/pdf/EtherNetIP_Scanner_Protocol_API_14_EN.pdf#page=160)

Two separate 15-second Windows loopback captures requested and negotiated 1,000 microseconds in both directions. Both closed cleanly with zero sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, and CSV overruns.

| Code | Receive watchdog (ms) | Rows written | Observed receive packets/s | Receive p99 / longest (microseconds) | Scanner / fixture skipped send slots |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 | 32 | 14,939 | 995.5 | 1,558 / 5,236 | 73 / 67 |
| 4 | 64 | 14,953 | 996.3 | 1,574 / 3,793 | 43 / 56 |

These are loopback socket measurements. The test suite checks all eight codes, legacy profiles, a reserved code, and the negotiated watchdog in the GUI and headless reports.

## GUI identity pinning

Headless GUI backend tests read the adapter identity in a standalone TCP session and then attempted an authorized exclusive-owner connection at the same address. A replacement fixture returned the same model with a different serial number. Its receipt showed identity traffic only, with no Forward_Open or cyclic output.

A matching fixture also verified the write permission gate. The GUI first declined the connection with an identity pin and without write confirmation. After confirmation, it opened at 8 ms, sent the staged test bytes and configuration to the loopback adapter, and confirmed Forward_Close. A unit test covered the pending-read gate and retention of a pin after a failed refresh. The loopback tests also checked that completing the read clears any pending bench and write confirmations.

Start the indicated loopback mode in one terminal. Run the corresponding test filter with `cargo test --locked --release --bin assembly-scanner <filter> -- --ignored` in another terminal.

| Fixture mode | Test filter |
|---|---|
| `qualify-replacement` | `manual_pinned_connection_blocks_a_replacement_before_writes` |
| `identity-then-owner` | `matching_pin_allows_separately_authorized_owner_connection` |

## Timed GUI capture

A headless GUI backend test armed a one-second capture and waited 1.05 seconds before connecting to the 8 ms loopback fixture. The timer started at the first input. The test then delayed GUI polling until 200 ms after the cutoff. The capture saved 125 rows across rotated parts, and the connection received 151 packets before the test disconnected and confirmed Forward_Close. The run report recorded the one-second request and completed timer.

A recorder test accepted an input timestamp one microsecond before the cutoff and excluded timestamps at and after it, across connection generations. Other tests covered early manual stop and saving and restoring the duration preference. The CLI regression completed a three-second capture with a one-second GUI duration in the same profile.

To repeat the GUI backend check, start the normal loopback fixture and run the test in a second terminal. The test opens no window.

```powershell
python tools/loopback_adapter.py .local/gui-timed-adapter.json --mode normal
```

```powershell
cargo test --locked --release --bin assembly-scanner timed_gui_capture_finishes_after_first_input_even_when_polling_is_delayed -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## Headless capture cutoff

A ten-second headless loopback capture requested and negotiated 1,000 microseconds in both directions. It confirmed Forward_Close and saved 9,930 rows across five CSV parts. The CSV first-to-last sample span was 9.999193 seconds. The receive socket observed 9,939 accepted packets over 10.008444 seconds, including nine packets after the recording deadline. The report-backed join verified all saved rows.

Receive p50, p95, p99, and longest spacing were 1,033, 1,251, 1,619, and 4,960 microseconds. There were zero sequence gaps, timeouts, or CSV overruns. The scanner skipped 54 send slots and the fixture skipped 70. These are loopback socket measurements.

The recorder test exercised timestamps before, at, and after the cutoff across generations. The GUI backend verified that its report counts the post-deadline packets when polling is delayed. Headless qualification compares CSV rows with in-window packets and retains the full connection metrics. The recovery test let the window expire during reconnect backoff and verified that the scanner opened no further connection. The independent 30 ms OpENer check saved 101 rows in its three-second window and confirmed Forward_Close.

## Startup timing

The Windows localhost fixture delayed its Forward_Open reply by 50 ms and waited 80 ms after the first heartbeat before sending input. The scanner requested and negotiated 8 ms in both directions. It wrote 125 rows in a one-second capture with a confirmed Forward_Close, zero sequence gaps, zero watchdog timeouts, and zero buffer overruns.

| Fixture case | Forward_Open exchange (µs) | First O-to-T send (µs) | First received UDP (µs) | First valid input (µs) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Delayed reply and input | 51,820 | 594 | 81,036 | 81,036 |
| No input traffic | 998 | 495 | — | — |
| Malformed input | 1,415 | 517 | 738 | — |
| CIP rejection | 226 | — | — | — |
| Identity mismatch | — | — | — | — |

The three I/O columns are measured from the end of the Forward_Open exchange, using the scanner host's monotonic clock. The malformed and quiet fixtures each reached the first-input timeout. The identity mismatch stopped before Forward_Open. Headless regression tests also check the saved GUI report and the timing entries before and after a CLI reconnect. These are localhost measurements.

Three one-second headless qualification trials requested and negotiated 1,000 microseconds in both directions. They wrote 998, 996, and 974 rows, with receive p99 spacing of 1,488, 1,533, and 2,028 microseconds and longest gaps of 2,403, 3,499, and 5,191 microseconds. All confirmed Forward_Close and had zero sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, and CSV overruns. The fixture skipped 2, 5, and 27 send slots before assigning sequence numbers.

## Class 1 packet trace correlation

A headless Windows fixture bound separate adapter ports to receive O-to-T traffic and send T-to-O inputs. The scanner requested and negotiated 8 ms in both directions, saved 251 rows in two seconds, and confirmed Forward_Close. The scanner and fixture agreed on the actual local UDP port (57113), the output destination port (57111), the first valid input source port (57112), and both connection IDs. There were zero receive sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, or CSV overruns.

The CLI reports omit the input source for silent or malformed traffic and omit the entire `cyclic_io` table if Forward_Open is rejected or never sent. The recovery test matched each attempt to the fixture's endpoints and connection IDs. Headless GUI backend checks verified the saved endpoint and ID fields.

An independent OpENer capture requested and negotiated 30 ms in both directions and saved 101 rows with no sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, or CSV overruns. Its outgoing destination and first input source were both `127.0.0.2:2222`.

The full headless qualification regression passed on the third run. Two earlier runs each had one 1 ms trial end at the 32 ms receive watchdog, after 33.350 ms and 32.647 ms of terminal input silence. Both confirmed Forward_Close and retained their endpoint and connection ID records. The fixture measured a 39.052 ms send gap in the second timeout case. The first timeout's cause remains unconfirmed. The watchdog and requested intervals were the same across runs.

## Watchdog silence diagnostics

A headless Windows loopback capture requested and negotiated 1,000 µs in both directions. It stopped producing input after sequence 75 while continuing to accept heartbeats. The scanner saved all 75 input rows and confirmed Forward_Close after the 32 ms receive watchdog expired.

| Metric | Observed |
|---|---:|
| Valid input silence at timeout | 33.802 ms |
| Successful scanner O-to-T sends observed during the silence | 33 |
| O-to-T packets received by the fixture after its last input send | 33 |
| Last receive-check gap | 2.019 ms |
| Longest receive-check gap during the silence | 2.716 ms |

The receive checks use host timestamps around the receive loop. The scanner and fixture count different socket events. In 8 ms first-input tests with silent and malformed traffic, both scanner reports recorded 251 successful O-to-T sends. The malformed case continued to receive UDP but accepted no input. The CLI recovery and headless GUI backend tests preserved the timeout diagnostics on the failed attempt and cleared them on the recovered connection.

A separate ten-second loopback capture requested and negotiated 1,000 µs in both directions. It confirmed Forward_Close and wrote 9,984 rows with zero sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, or CSV overruns. Receive p50, p95, p99, and longest spacing were 1,029, 1,233, 1,481, and 2,978 µs. The scanner skipped 22 send slots and the fixture skipped 16. The CSV cutoff excluded three additional accepted packets while the connection stopped.

## Offline input payload preview

The headless CLI regression decoded a four-byte payload with a little-endian counter, an LSB-first bit, and a swapped 16-bit word. The preview showed all three values and flagged the two columns selected for CSV. A legacy profile displayed its primary `value` field.

A second payload verified signed big-endian decoding with word reversal, a 32-bit float, the full unsigned 64-bit range, and NUL-terminated UTF-8 with a newline. The command decoded the sample with an unfinished connection profile and an empty CSV selection. It rejected malformed hex, short and oversized payloads, and a named field that extended beyond the assembly. All preview checks ran offline.

## Read-only software integration

The 8 ms Windows localhost check exercised the HTTP API, MQTT publisher and named shared memory simultaneously. HTTP and the memory mapping stayed open across scanner reconnect. An independent broker fixture dropped its first TCP connection and received fresh MQTT samples after reconnect. HTTP continued while a client held the shared-memory mutex. Shared memory continued while an HTTP client stalled mid-request. The CLI saved 468 CSV rows with zero capture or integration queue overruns. The headless GUI backend test also fetched a live API sample during capture.

```powershell
python tools/test_integration.py .\target\release\eipmaster-cli.exe .\.local\integration-check
```

One five-second headless pair requested and negotiated 1,000 µs in both directions. Both runs confirmed Forward_Close with zero receive sequence gaps, watchdog timeouts, or CSV overruns.

| Software feeds | CSV rows | Receive p50 / p95 / p99 (µs) | Longest receive gap (µs) | Scanner skipped send slots |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Disabled | 4,997 | 1,029 / 1,103 / 1,504 | 2,141 | 3 |
| HTTP, MQTT and shared memory | 4,998 | 1,006 / 1,117 / 1,343 | 2,256 | 5 |

The enabled run recorded zero integration queue drops. The client polled 221 HTTP batches and read shared memory 221 times. The MQTT fixture received 104 publications, including publications after its deliberate disconnect. The final API poll was 14 samples behind the completed connection. These figures measure one localhost pair. Physical-device timing and transport latency require separate measurement.

## Future-chat documentation and skill discovery

The repository now routes future chats through AGENTS.md and the ethernetip-workbench skill to operational and development guides. The portable package includes these files and tools/install_skill.py. The installed local skill entry point points to the current source location.

The skill validator passed for the tracked skill and installed entry point. Installer checks covered repeat installation, custom directories with spaces, preservation of an unrelated skill and rejection of the canonical source as an install destination. Documentation checks resolved relative references and ran the documented offline help, EDS, preflight and payload-decoding recipes.

## Physical bench acceptance

Physical-device measurements require a connected bench adapter and verified device settings. First verify the Identity Object and the intended profile, preferably input-only. Confirm output ownership and write permissions before using a profile that owns outputs, asserts Run or sends configuration bytes. Then run the Windows GUI and logger with the requested RPIs and record the Forward_Open actual intervals separately from socket spacing percentiles, longest gap, sequence gaps, timeouts, missed send slots and capture losses. Use a capture at the NIC or switch if wire-level timestamps are required.
